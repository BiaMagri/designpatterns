## Introduction

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They provide a way to describe and communicate design decisions, and can help improve the maintainability, scalability, and flexibility of software systems. This repository aims to provide a practical understanding of design patterns by providing code examples in Java.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/BiaMagri/designpatterns.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you can navigate to the directory and explore the code examples for each design pattern.

## Design Patterns

This repository currently includes the following design patterns:

- [Simple Factory Method](https://github.com/BiaMagri/designpatterns/tree/master/src/main/java/com/java/simplefactory)

Each design pattern has its own directory, which contains a brief description of the pattern, code examples, and any relevant resources.
